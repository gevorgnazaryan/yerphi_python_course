2. Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
3. Compare the length of your first_name and your last_name
4. Declare 6 as num_1 and 4 as num_2

    7. Find floor division of  num_1 by num_2 and assign the value to a variable floor_division
5. The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
    1. Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle by taking user input()
    2. Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle by taking user input()
    hint : input() function ca be used  to take input from user (we will cover it on next lesson) but syntax is simple:
